# Discofy
Discord bot

This bot is designed to run on a rasberry pi and will attempt to find the matching song on spotify when a youtube music video is posted on a discord chat.

Some setup is required, namely the addition of your relevant security keys in the securityCredentials.py file, and I've provided an example template for this file
Also you will need to add this code to a raspberry pi and to install the chromium browser

This is a prototype and while the design has potential this is both a very early atttempt for myself writing in python and probably not the best solution
